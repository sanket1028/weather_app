ยก Hola !

I created a weather app that has 2 main features

1. Show the weather of user based on user location
	-> I have used Geolocation API for fetching user latitude and longitude coordinates.
	-> Then the for user location weather information is feteched by open weather API.
	-> Then based on the user's loaction weather information is fetched through weather API.
	
2. User can search for any city or country weather information
	-> Same the data is feteched through open weather API.
	


ยก Gracias !
